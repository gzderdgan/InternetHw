First I prefer to complete my school home works and study well then I watch TV. I think I have a good hobby because watching TV provides me good knowledge in many areas. I generally see news and discovery channels including animal planet on the TV. I also watch good cartoons which give me new and creative ideas to make arts and cartoons. My parents appreciate my hobby and they become very happy when they listen all the latest news through me in my voice.
